## 🧹Data Summary & Cleaning

The dataset includes:

-Demographics:
-Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status, Income

-Engagement Metrics: Active Months, Contact Count

-Financial Data: Credit Limit, Utilization Ratio, Transaction Count

Cleaning Steps:
-Removed ~10% of missing demographic fields (kept as "unknown" to preserve integrity).

-Standardized variable names.

-Prepared pivot tables and summary stats for attrited vs. existing customers.

## 📈Key Insights

### Exploratory Dashboard

Interactive visuals enabled filtering by gender, education, and marital status to identify numeric trends driving attrition.

-Insight: Retaining high-utilization and higher-income customers leads to stronger growth.

### Transaction Volume by Retention Pattern

Scatterplot analysis revealed mid-tier customers (50–80 transactions) are at the highest churn risk.

-Strategy: Target retention programs for this group while replicating successful engagement tactics from high-value customers.

### Attrited Customers by Inactivity Period

Bar graphs highlighted the correlation between inactivity duration and attrition rate.

-Strategy: Launch re-engagement campaigns targeting age-based inactivity segments.

### Expenditure vs. Relationship Count

Spending decreases as customers hold more relationships.

-Insight: Multiple products may dilute engagement; reward customers with 1–2 relationships to sustain spending.

### Transaction Count vs. Revolving Balance

Scatterplot revealed diverse customer behaviors across balance levels.

-Strategy: Offer premium cards to high-balance, low-transaction customers and educate others on card benefits.

##  🔮Future Scope
-Build predictive models to forecast attrition trends.
-Analyze top-tier customers to identify loyalty drivers.
-Integrate digital engagement metrics (e.g., mobile app usage).
-Expand segmentation to understand spending and payment behavior deeper.
