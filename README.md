## 🧹Data Summary & Cleaning

### Dataset includes:
- Demographics :Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status, Income
- Engagement Metrics: Active Months, Contact Count
- Financial Data: Credit Limit, Utilization Ratio, Transaction Count

### Cleaning Steps:
- Removed ~10% of missing demographic fields (kept as "unknown" to preserve integrity).
- Standardized variable names.
- Prepared pivot tables and summary stats for attrited vs. existing customers.

## 📈Key Insights

### Exploratory Dashboard

Interactive visuals enabled filtering by gender, education, and marital status to identify numeric trends driving attrition.

- Insight: Retaining high-utilization and higher-income customers leads to stronger growth.

### Transaction Volume by Retention Pattern

Scatterplot analysis revealed mid-tier customers (50–80 transactions) are at the highest churn risk.

- Strategy: Target retention programs for this group while replicating successful engagement tactics from high-value customers.

### Attrited Customers by Inactivity Period

Bar graphs highlighted the correlation between inactivity duration and attrition rate.

- Strategy: Launch re-engagement campaigns targeting age-based inactivity segments.

### Expenditure vs. Relationship Count

Spending decreases as customers hold more relationships.

- Insight: Multiple products may dilute engagement; reward customers with 1–2 relationships to sustain spending.

### Transaction Count vs. Revolving Balance

Scatterplot revealed diverse customer behaviors across balance levels.

- Strategy: Offer premium cards to high-balance, low-transaction customers and educate others on card benefits.

##  🔮Future Scope
- Build predictive models to forecast attrition trends.
- Analyze top-tier customers to identify loyalty drivers.
- Integrate digital engagement metrics (e.g., mobile app usage).
- Expand segmentation to understand spending and payment behavior deeper.
